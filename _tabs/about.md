I'm Nick and I'm a War Game Modeling & Simulation developer.  This is my homelab blog, dedicated to documenting my misadventures in system and networking architecture, developing AI-enhanced applications, and learning emerging technologies.  I'm currently experimenting with large language models, agentic AI workflows, and automation pipelines.

If I wax poetic about production and project management, you have my sincerest apologies.
